## Refactoring Documentation

#### What is refactoring

Refactoring is the process of modifying the existing code to improve it, without changing the external functionality.

#### Why refactoring

* Code is changed during development process.
* Improve the code, because your first version is not always the best.

#### When to refactoring

Signs that code needs refactoring sometime called "code smells". Here is some example of code smells.

* Duplicate code
* Long class, method or parameter list
* Divergent Change
* Feature Envy 
* Complex expression

#### Where is the refactoring goal

To answer the question "What is good code", we should backup and ask "What do customers(stakeholders) want". Here is some examples of good code.

* Easy to use - not too complex and understandable
* Does what user wants - easy to modify, changed according to feedback
* Efficient - avoid duplicate function, use caching
* No errors or defects - unit testing, CI
